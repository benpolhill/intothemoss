What's the worst thing that could happen?
...
That's only bad for me, my friends and family. And possibly for the business continuity of the company I happen to be working for at the time. What's the actual worst thing that could ever happen to everyone everywhere ever?
...
When could this happen?
...
In the meantime, what's the worst thing that could happen to all non-living things?
...
Yeah, but what about non-living entities?
...
OK. But what about non-existing entities?
...
Well, one thing that could happen to them is that they start to exist, right?
...
Really? Even if they start to exist during the total collapse of the universe?
...
What if they came into being already possessing all knowledge of everything that could ever happen?
...
Perhaps they could feel that something bad was happening, due to the cataclysmic and totalising sensation of burning pain coursing through every fibre of their new-found existence?
...
Who would not consider the non-knowledge of total, maximal pain a bad thing, if that pain was a very real and visceral experience to the existent?

There is nothing that could happen to non-existing entities, as they do not exist.
...
Yes, but that would not be considered a bad thing.
...
No, because they would not be aware of it.
...
Even then, it would not be considered a bad thing, as they would have no way of knowing that anything bad was happening.
