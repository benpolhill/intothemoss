[Music] after all the poet donohue said he was once having such a hard time with his publisher every manuscript he sent came back completely rejected with every passage scornfully annotated struck through rubbished he said it was like entrusting the contents of one's home to the removal men and seeing the one-way flow of each item passing down the line pecked to their removal strings hoisted out of the empty chamber one by one like old laundry on an assembly line until one day one item got sent the other way spared being heaped in the dewey memory dump the notebook was returned with one passage boldly circled multiple times finally the annotation beside it read this is it and as donna who read the words inside the circle it was as if the literary temple he had been trying to construct for the last weeks months years even fell away like a cheap edifice like the mere scaffold built around these resonant lines that seemed to pulse with every word's truth and to think in the scribble of composition he had barely noticed the scratch upon the page but now here they were a gleaming epithet for all times crystallized in ink the passage read learn to say hola live life to the cola [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] when jesus taught his enemies how to fight underwater they would always want to do it in the shallow end where they could feel their feet securely on the pool's floor no jesus would assert you must fight me in the deep end where your blows may slosh freely and your feet do not know the ground so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so so think of consciousness think of where it's described as a pool sometimes consciousness is poor you can see clearly the bottom of the pool the stillness of the pool if the pool is agitated then things are stirred up all the sediments of previous consciousness stirred up in certain moments unrelated the feeding you had of the baby the thought of 10 minutes ago the person who you met before is there next to each other agitated moving around in the same current predated only through their movement and currents with all clouding consciousness and its consciousness [Music] consciousness and mind consciousness [Music] i went into a library to find a book about wales the only thing on the non-fiction shelf was something by a youtuber doing a serialized trolling of a well-beloved cartoon narwhal some two decades his senior now whatevs shrug godly slapped over the scene where the narwhal guides from motherless comrades to safety an eyebrow popping towards sponsored hairstyle on her head jammed between narwhala and her long lost sister the latter's warm reconciliatory smile partially obscured by the tuber's colgate smirk this will not do i said i'm rather looking for something with a semblance of facticity tactically it's not a word said the assistant you mean factual either factual or fictual and this is the only one about a whale on the factual shelf i told him i didn't think it should be on the factual shelf consisting as it did of a clownishly coordinated series of superimposed derisions in the cowardice of retrospection but then for some reason i thought of moby dick [Music] or was it just moby [Music] my [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] set the stalls for trees [Music] range it all [Music] set stones for trees [Music] this is [Music] it all range it all.
