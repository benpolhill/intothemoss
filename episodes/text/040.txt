I was talking to Mrs Ear Trike about Mr Rare Kites, when Mr Teak Riser butted in on behalf of Sir Marketer, who works for Mr Risk Eater – to my mind anyway. 
“Where’s Mr Kit Eraser?” he said to me, “He’s been neglecting his duties; he’s like the invisible man.”

[Song for Lady MacBeth]

Letdown
=======

You said there’d be green pastures 
And a cabin by the lake 
You said there’d be canapés  
And mimosas on Cornish slate 
You said I’d be able to wear a radiant foil crown,
Jewelled knee pads
And ride a silver skate board 
You said the ashes would be presented in a polished ebony urn
At a special ceremony at the Ministry of Sound
You said there’d be a special pen I could use 
To write on trees 
You said there’d be soca in the jukebox And salmon in the stream
You said you would have drained the batteries in all the forklift trucks 
And rusted all the nails in the pallets 
At least an hour before lunch
You said I’d be able to wear my lime green dress shirt
With the lilac buttons and clapperboard cufflinks 
You said there’d be four jokers in this pack
And the kings would be removed 
You said I’d be able to slide on my knees 
Down that bank on the eighteenth hole 
And when I landed face down in the bunker
You said, the sand would be edible 
And taste of kelp sherbet 
You said there’d be no more lead in the ice cream
And no more arsenic in the acorns 	

But you lied. You let me down. None of what you said turned out to be true 
None of it held water 
None of it played out 
The duck bore no feathers 
The tanks held no oxygen 
The pop had no fizz
The sponge had no spring in it 
The men had no standing
The mines had collapsed  The voucher had expired

And I don't forgive you
Probably never will
You've been such a letdown
You let down me,
You've let down yourself,
You've let down the class,
You've let down the town, the whole town
And the county
Everyone in the county is so, so bitterly argry with you
And it's not OK.
