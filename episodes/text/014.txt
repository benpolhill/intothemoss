anticipation set upon the body's lock box dog snuzzling at the thighs snow mist blood fresh over a split arm day outdated sunset a reddened glow cast over the woods

the hoping hearts among them start shattering relentlessly reaching forwards in time

the mana children fire a fox from a cannon towards the evergreen cops

this sound filtering out into the surroundings

signals

is

we say thank you fox for being our friend

see no more tradition suggests if the eyes are wide on impact a homunculus is born out of the animal body split open on frozen ground a protective vassal to watch over the auspicious events to follow but seeing the festive partygoers return indoors we find an animal whose form is splayed helplessly over a pile of decaying tree trunks

chad don't go check the fox huh did you ever go to the kids we don't need to be doing that it's going to be a mighty year i can tell i'll check on the scene just to be sure it won't take long then shoot yourself

you never

get the kids inside look at the chimneys

and then a large man approaches out of the night's murk blushed the spectacled bearded his voluminous lungs bellowing a fine mist

he kneels down beside the fox first tentatively on one knee and then the other body heat melting white flakes cloth drinking up water the fresh red dye of his onesie soaking out from the knees carefully gathering the fox in his arms while holding his ear close to the soft wet face in search of breath he gently carries the sagging unresponsive animal wrapping it tenderly sharing warmth

is

peace

mr matthews would you mind running through once more the events of the night in question well you see it was out through the stables right having a sick of that right oh by the way don't tell jeff i don't you don't know me i don't know jeffrey he was out there and i was looking after the cops you know because he destroyed the camera but usually he comes off with this big juvenile chair and then go right into that channel he said you know the one goes

i really don't know that no no no no i don't know i don't know it's only saying i was waiting for that one because that's the song for me to go in and start meeting the pudding right but it didn't come yet so he's there and he saw his team i was coming out between the trees and i thought to myself

there shouldn't be someone coming out there

and so what did this thing look like oh well that's a good question that is well looked a little bit like a dude you know but really brown with little patches of white on it and right he came out and i saw it going over the fox and landed there like split on the ground oh and i was like there was deer going over the fox and then i realized

cookies out around and i see him leaning down grabbing a handful of snow plowing at the fox like he's trying to bury us well at this point you know i gotta get a second opinion gonna seem right so i shot back to stan over at the pump house

but anyway

well what's going in here

i don't know where they went any idea any idea whatsoever no your sausage and this stan

professor alderwick how would you characterize the events of the night in question my recollections yes fungible is mine not replaceable you think mine makes it different is different because the words are used to describe it or it refines what you've already heard from the ones that they use but they all make the same thing you're looking to focus pinpoint narrow down what can be seen that is my remit you want to say there was this thing which was a him and he picked up a thing and this thing was a fox well i would but then you don't see and you can't unsee that so i'll describe it please but through

do you need some water would you like a glass of water are you oh oh my oh my oh my god oh dear god

that's what i saw

me

is

you don't know

the wishes

let alone oh

you
