my friend john became quite introverted after the death of his partner oliver previously an ambassador in any company he began to shy away from socializing stop going to pedunk he moved about aimlessly and lost in thought engaged in inner battles the normal stages of grief and natural we all assumed

well then then when you stood in him there was a faint breeze blowing his way from all directions into chivalrous as time went on it became more pronounced small particles lifted and were carried by carried by some invisible agency towards him dust food crumbs and things like that though his body had become a hoover it was quite handy in a sad way gradually though larger objects started shuffling towards him i remember one weekend taking him for sunday lunch with morris to cheer him up and i watched a potato on my plate roll off while morris who was next to him self-titled ripple on the surface of a gravy tom's own peas were plunging from the table like lemmings into his lap or leaping onto his chest and head as he bent down to attract his fog from the floor by new year's he was housebound covered into charities familiar thingami's photos holiday trinkets old shopping lists clocks bedding dried flowers and potpourri potatoes you know everything had squashed pushed compressed into his new confirmation even the walls of his bungalow were creaking under some compulsion to move inward

in april a few days after the walls eventually gave way and the roof folded in i visited him for the last time with a rope tied around my waist and my twin daughters manning the winch and hand crank i crawled into the passage that fall onto his head so i could clean up his face and block his nose and mouth check and repair the mesh that line the channel it was hard work especially with the force of the pull i knew it was heading the way these things do as it did with my sister

his release from the struggles dumped on him came by the end of that same week it was accompanied by a thunderous cacophony as the monumental structure caved in collapsed the suspension dropping to the ground attention released sending the debris clattering and crashing racing down to the ground hunted back to gravity

from the center of the fire rapidly burned leaving nothing but cinders by the time the fire engines pulled up and gave it a symbolic dousing for the silent spectators

so

do

i'm writing this with a heavy heart

it's taken me a long time to come to this point and i say this with great difficulty i'm very very sorry but i can't see you anymore slowly i have come to realize that you're a psycho

i'm sure you're saying to yourself right now me a psycho no you're the psycho and this is precisely the point i am the psycho not just any old psycho i'm afraid i don't have room in my life for wannabes

but we had some fine times we really did do you remember when we broke into the british museum and took pickaxes to the rosetta stone that was a perfect evening

but in the end let's be honest there was too much jealousy take for example when i burnt down notre dame do you remember what you did

yeah you planted a bomb on a golden gate bridge i mean seriously what if someone had gotten hurt i'm sorry it's too vulgar for words i destroy one of the finest works of art possibly ever created and the fulcrum of a nation's faith and you destroy a bridge people need across that every day to get to work did you ever think about them no i'm sure you didn't because i'm sorry to say you're just an everyday psycho

now darling put down that pickaxe and don't even think about trying to embed it in my head take a deep breath and try to think about what i've said i'm sure you'll realize that it all makes sense and plus you'll easily find someone else there are plenty more loonies in the bin that i can assure you but me i've got to focus on myself right now i've got big plans you'll hear about them soon affectionately easy

seagull stitch is wearing thin silk stretched out in a soldier's tin

this song's about a boy's young skin it's right

right with pocket clamps all circumstantial the seagull stitch is long unpicked the silkworm perished in a tiger's fist and all the patterns that you can knit they're right

dolphins have them so do your laces up

tight run into the sea you
