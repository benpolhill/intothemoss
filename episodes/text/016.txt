Everything is broken. 
The mid-century teak and grey linen divan.
The Vienna twin-weight wall clock.
The brass and opaline globe desk lamps.
The Queen Anne walnut tea table.
The Chippendale mahogany drop-front bureau.
And the gilded crystal prism chandelier. 

And when I say broken, I don’t just mean that the upholstery has torn a little under the armrest, 
Or that the taper spring in the pendulum fixing has snapped,
Or that the glass has chipped at the fitting,
Or that the tray-top molding has splintered at one of the joints,
Or that the back-panel has buckled and slipped from its frame,
Or that some of the crystals have started to sag asymmetrically. 

No. I mean everything’s been completely broken down, into tiny, tiny pieces. Smashed to smithereens. Ground down into fine particles. Utterly pulverised.

And the cyclonic winds from the hole above have whipped these sands into a shallow mound at the centre of the room. Everything that was once distinct in function, form and substance is now a compounded mass of debris. 

Not that I really mind. To be honest, I always despised the hotchpotch of furniture in this lobby; the mismatched periods and styles. How there would be Danish-modern teak and crushed velvet sofa, and in front of it a Victorian rosewood occasional table - stained with rings from the Turkish coffee and sticky patches from the jalebi they would serve waiting guests. And those austere Edwardian mahogany bookcases stuffed with gaudy pamphlets and brochures detailing local attractions…  Everything was scattered incongruously about the room even before the strike; the latter just refined this calamity.

But it’s all dust now & what am I to do but lie here, resigned and supine; flat on my back on this bed of fine debris, rhythmically fanning out my arms and legs in sweeping arcs, making a dust-angel
And you, with your lens trained down, pulling up and away from me, revealing the fallout of the devastation and the shadowy patches of wallpaper where the bookcases and bureaus used to stand, 
The shrinking form of the dust-angel on its glistening dune of atomised antiques, and up, through the five-petaled aperture in the lobby ceiling where the chandelier used to hang, into the first floor apartment, rising up still through the cruciform hole into the second, through the three-petaled hole to the third, and through the two-petaled hole, still glowing poppy-red at its edges, into the penthouse suite, until finally emerging through the missile’s initial entry point - a neatly circular aperture rendered by the stage 1 blast of the augmenting shaped-charge warhead, with its enhanced post-entry target fragmentation. And you could continue the missile’s path upwards and backwards, to the Golden Goose drone that launched the strike… but, wait. Narrow the focus now and fall back down, retrace the course that bore through the five floors of the Reuters hotel, ripping that star into the lobby ceiling and pulverising everything below. I received the tip off. The guests were bused out to another hotel just outside of Bruges. But I stayed; behind the maple Art Deco counter. And now I’m part of the powder. And something’s making a dust angel in me.
